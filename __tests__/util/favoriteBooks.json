He wrote for nearly every character being published at the time, and his original creationsÑincluding Firestorm, Steel and VixenÑchanged comics history forever. ConwayÕs work had a profound effect on the legacy of Batman, with his creations Killer Croc and Jason Todd becoming mainstays in the legend of the Dark Knight. Illustrated by artists including, Gene Colan, Don Newton, Klaus Janson and Jos Luis Garca-Lpez and featuring guest appearances by Superman, Man-Bat, and the whole Bat-Family, these classic tales showcase one of the greatest talents ever to write for the Caped Crusader! Collects Batman #337-346, #348, Detective Comics #505-513, WorldÕs Finest Comics #270.",

    "description": "Conan is back, and at the top of his form! SFWA Grand Master L. Sprague de Camp was revered in the genre of fantasy for both his fiction and nonfiction. Booklist praised his novel The Honorable Barbarian, saying: \"The action is brisk, and the worlds and characters are described with de Camp's deft, light touch . . . thoroughly agreeable entertainment,\" while Kirkus Reviews said of The Pixilated Peeress \"the unassuming style and verve of the telling keep the pages turning. Pure prose junk-food.\" But more important, L. Sprague de Camp wrote Dark Valley Destiny, the definitive biography of Conan's creator, Robert E. Howard, leaving little wonder as to why Conan and the Spider God is considered one of the finest novels in the canon of Conan. Son of a blacksmith, a former slave and thief, Conan the Cimmerian has risen to the rank of Captain of the Royal Guard. But as usual, trouble is his bedfellow. Forced to kill while defending himself, Conan must flee the vengeance of the High Priest of Erlik. Foraging through field and forest, meeting friend and foe, Conan cuts a bloody swath through assassins and bounty hunters all the way to the sinister temple of Zath, where he encounters the huge and hideous Spider God. Facing certain death, Conan becomes both the hunter . . . and the hunted. Conan and the Spider God is a thrilling adventure of the mighty barbarian, from one of the genre's most revered authors. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
